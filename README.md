Welcome to SynQL, a crappy web frontend demonstrating the capabilities of metanym-class streaming with TweeQL enabled by ECONTAINS..



#INSTALL#

Ok lets be honest here, I've never tried to share a Pylons project and at the moment, I'm probably not doing it correctly. Since everything is self contained and we don't actually use a database, you should be able to just download the repo and run a server with paster.

eg:

>git clone git://github.com/bh0085/synql.git

>cd synql

>paster serve --reload development.ini

And then navigate your browser to 

>http://localhost:8181/demo


If that fails then I'm probably missing something.

#Thanks#

Many thanks to Adam Marcus!
